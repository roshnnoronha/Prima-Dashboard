<h4>Managing complex projects with Prima Dashboard</h4>
<p>As a manager or a lead engineer in a project, most of your time goes in collecting and interpreting data.
Now with Prima Dashboard you can leave the data collection to be done systematically as the project progresses.
Prima Dashboard collects data regarding activity hours logs, commodities and deliverable
status directly form the source to give you key insights into the progress of the project. With customizable KPI indicators, 
facility to import and export to Excel, and the ability to generate pdf reports, you can now spend your time more productively.</p>

<h4>Track activities in real time</h4>
<p>With Prima Dashboard you can now manage activities like never before. As a manager, one of the keys to a successful completion 
of a project, is how to manage the available human resources. Prima Dashboard gives you the flexibility to create and assign activities
to available people so that resources are utilised more efficiently. As the users book hours against the activities assigned to them, 
the manager gets real time data on the progress and can decide whether or not to allocate more resources. Activities can 
be reassigned or branched out to other users giving a high degree of control on who does what in a project.</p>

<h4>Commodities matter</h4>
<p>In the end what matters in any engineering project is the cost of the end product. But managing the cost of commodities involved
often is time consuming and tedious. Now with Prima Dashboard you can seamlessly track the progress of the commodities as the 
project progress. With every user being responsible for tracking the commodities of their activities, the manager gets up-to-date information on
the current status of the commodities released. A key decision making tool to help deliver the project within budget.</p>

<h4>Deliverables! Deliverables!</h4>
<p>
With clients constantly demanding that more and more deliverables be produced in shorter time, managing deliverables is becoming a daunting 
task. Prima Dashboard helps by allowing the user to associate deliverables to activities so that as the activity is completed so is the deliverable,
easing the process of deliverable tracking. Progress on a deliverable can be customised so that activities are associated with only partial progress, 
giving the user a wide range of options for realistic progress tracking.
